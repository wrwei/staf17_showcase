\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements for the exchange of dependability-related information (ODE), and the specification of modular DDIs;
	\item Requirements for the tooling support needed to check the validity of the available dependability information and to model DDIs;
	\item Requirements for applying the DEIS approach within the automotive, healthcare and the railway domain and evaluating the project results compared to the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice.
