The open and cooperative nature of Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) poses a significant new challenge in assuring dependability. The DEIS project addresses this important and unsolved challenge by developing technologies that enable a science of dependable system integration. 
Such technologies facilitate the efficient synthesis of components and systems based on their dependability information, covering application domains such as automotive, railways, home automation and healthcare.

The DEIS project will bring significant impact to the CPS market by providing new engineering methods and tools reducing development time and cost of ownership, as well as supporting integration and interoperability of dependability information over the product lifecycle and over the supply chain.
